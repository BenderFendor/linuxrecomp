"""Feed the addresses a *run* discovered back into the next disassembly.

Static analysis cannot see every function, and two kinds are routinely
invisible no matter how good the scan gets:

  * **Indirect-call targets.** Where a vtable slot or a function pointer
    actually points is a runtime fact. `tools/rtti` will recover some of them
    statically for a C++ binary that kept its RTTI; most binaries did not.
  * **Thread and callback entry points.** The address handed to `CreateThread`
    is only ever *pushed* as an argument -- nothing calls it -- so no scan
    finds it, it gets no dispatch entry, and the thread silently never starts.
    The process then exits cleanly after a few API calls, which reads like a
    successful run rather than like zero progress.

The `recomp32` runtime already prints both, from the dispatch-failure paths of
RECOMP_ICALL and RECOMP_ITAIL:

    ICALL: unresolved VA 0x004A1C30 from 0x0048D4E0
    ITAIL: unresolved VA 0x004B2088 from 0x00401D10

Today a human reads those out of a console and hand-edits a seed list; several
projects carry one. This closes the loop.

    python tools/disasm/seed_from_log.py run.log game.exe --seeds config/seeds.json
    python tools/disasm/disasm32.py game.exe --seed-functions config/seeds.json -o funcs.json

An address the program mentioned is NOT automatically a function
----------------------------------------------------------------
A garbage slot points at data just as easily, and seeding data is worse than
the missing target was: it splits a real function in half and can break the
build, where the missing target only broke one dispatch. So every candidate
has to clear two gates:

  1. it lies in an executable section, and
  2. `probes_as_function_body` reads it as code -- it decodes forward to a
     `ret` or a tail jump without hitting bytes that are not instructions.

Both are needed. The section test alone lets through any four bytes that point
into `.text`; the probe alone accepts data that happens to decode, and a table
of code addresses decodes very happily indeed.

The caller is kept as a note. `ICALL ... from 0x0048D4E0` names the function
that made the call, and when a seed turns out to be wrong, the caller is where
you go to find out why.
