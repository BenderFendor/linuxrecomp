"""Score function recovery against a reference catalog.

Recursive descent tells you how many functions it found. It cannot tell you
how many of them are real. This scores a disasm32 catalog against a reference
-- a linker map, a PDB export, or another tool's analysis -- and reports
precision and recall on function *start addresses*.

The interesting output is not the score but the shape of the errors, because
two very different defects both read as "false positive":

  split     the address lands inside a function the reference knows about, so
            one function got entered twice. Harmless-ish for a lift: it
            duplicates code rather than inventing it.
  invented  the address lands outside every known function, so the scan
            probably decoded data as code. That lifts to garbage.

A third kind is not an error at all and must not be scored as one. A catalog
entry marked `"entry_kind": "alias"` is the disassembler saying "something
branches here and the lifter needs a body at this address" -- explicitly NOT
"a function starts here". A shared epilogue, a switch arm reached from another
function, an alternate entry point. It is expected to land inside a known
function, because that is what it is for.

Counting those as false positives measures a design decision instead of a
defect, and it is not a rounding error: on Trespasser 6,427 of 7,364 false
positives were aliases -- 87% of the reported error. Precision here is computed
over `entry_kind == "start"` only, and aliases are reported on their own line.

Telling them apart needs function *ranges*, not just starts, so references
that carry an end address (IDA exports, PDBs) get the better breakdown.

    python score_recovery.py --reference ida_funcs.json --candidate funcs.json
    python score_recovery.py --selftest

Where the reference carries end addresses, function *ends* are scored too, over
the true positives only -- an end is meaningless for an address where no
function starts. A wrong end is a different failure from a wrong start and the
scan can be perfect at one and bad at the other:

  short     the recovered function stops before the real one does, so its tail
            was never lifted. When the tail is the epilogue, every caller
            silently loses whatever the prologue saved.
  long      it runs past the real end and swallows what follows.

Make both sides mean the same thing by "end" before trusting the end numbers.
A disassembler's end is the end of the last instruction it decoded. IDA's runs
to the start of the next function, so it includes the linker's alignment
padding, and comparing the two directly makes correct functions look truncated.

That is not a rounding error. On Trespasser, 2,417 functions scored short
against untrimmed ends and 1,984 of them -- 82% -- had nothing but 0xCC and
0x90 in the gap. They were right. The 433 that remained were real, and 98% of
those were embedded jump tables, which is a genuine defect worth chasing. Left
uncorrected, the reference buried a 433-function signal under four times as
much noise.

So walk each reference end back over trailing 0xCC and 0x90 when you build it.
Not 0x00: that is a legal encoding () and trimming it eats real
code.

A reference is a second opinion, not truth, unless it came from symbols.
Where the two disagree, go look before believing either.
