"""bswap: how a compiler writes htonl inline.

Found by lifting a second Lindbergh game rather than a second copy of the
first. It sits right after `call inet_addr`, and beside a `ror bx, 8` doing
the 16-bit half, so any binary that opens a socket has some.

Register-only and 32-bit only. The 16-bit encoding is architecturally
undefined - real parts zero the register - so a compiler never emits it, and
a 16-bit operand here means data is being read as code.

Run: py -3.11 tools/lift/test_bswap.py
