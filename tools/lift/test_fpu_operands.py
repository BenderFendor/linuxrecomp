"""Which x87 operand the lifter reads.

Capstone is not consistent about how it spells an x87 register operand. Most
forms carry one register: `fld st(2)` is ['st(2)']. Two carry both, with the
implicit st(0) FIRST: `fxch st(2)` is ['st(0)', 'st(2)'] and `fcmovb st(2)` is
['st(0)', 'st(2)']. A lifter that reaches for ops[0] on those two gets st(0)
every time, emits a swap of a register with itself, and produces code that
compiles and runs with the x87 stack quietly in the wrong order.

That is not a crash, so nothing catches it downstream: it surfaces as one
wrong float somewhere in a matrix, hundreds of frames later. Hence this test.

Run: py -3.11 tools/lift/test_fpu_operands.py
