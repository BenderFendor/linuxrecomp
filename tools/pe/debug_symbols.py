"""Recover which source file each function came from, using the binary's own
`__FILE__` strings.

An `assert` bakes `__FILE__` into the binary as a string literal and references
it from the code of the function containing the assert. Plenty of shipped
"release" builds keep some of their asserts -- a subsystem built with NDEBUG
off, a library compiled separately, a developer who left them in on purpose --
so the strings are there far more often than you would expect.

That gives two passes:

  direct        A function references "AIMain.cpp" -> it was compiled from
                AIMain.cpp. Majority vote when a function references more than
                one, since inlining pulls a callee's asserts into its caller.

  interpolated  The linker emits each object file's functions contiguously, so
                an unattributed run bracketed by two functions that agree on
                the same file almost certainly belongs to that file too. Only
                runs whose endpoints agree are filled, and never across a
                section boundary -- different sections are different link units
                and contiguity means nothing between them.

    python tools/pe/debug_symbols.py game.exe --functions funcs.json -o src.json

This does not name functions. It says which *file* each one came from, which is
what turns 40,000 anonymous functions into a browsable tree and tells you which
ones are worth reverse-engineering together.

Ported from xboxrecomp's `tools/debug_symbols/`. The Xbox version consumes a
strings.json with cross-references already computed; pcrecomp has no such file,
so the references are found here by scanning each function's bytes for the
address of a string -- which is what `push offset aFoo` compiles to.
