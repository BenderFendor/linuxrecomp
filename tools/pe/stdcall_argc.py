stdcall_argc.py - Derive Win32 stdcall argument counts without typing them.

Every import shim in a recompiled Win32 program has to pop exactly the argument
slots the real API pops. Get one wrong and the simulated stack silently
desynchronises: every value read after that call is garbage, and the symptom
shows up nowhere near the cause. It is a bad thing to get from a hand-typed
table -- and hand-typed tables do drift. The one carried by the Fury3/Hellbender
projects gives `waveOutOpen` 7 arguments; the real one takes 6.

The answer is already on the machine. In the Windows SDK's **32-bit** import
libraries, stdcall exports are decorated `_Name@N`, where N is the argument byte
count the compiler computed from the real header. Four bytes per 32-bit slot.

    from stdcall_argc import ArgcResolver
    r = ArgcResolver()
    r.lookup('KERNEL32.dll', 'CreateFileA')     -> 7
    r.lookup('DSOUND.dll',   'ordinal_1')       -> 3   (via DirectSoundCreate)
    r.lookup('KERNEL32.dll', 'NoSuchExport')    -> None

Imports referenced by ordinal are resolved against the system copy of the DLL's
export table first, then looked up by name.

That covers plain Win32. A real game's import table has three more kinds, and
an SDK-only lookup returns None for every one of them -- on Star Wars: Force
Commander it resolved 135 of 307:

  * **Third-party stdcall DLLs.** `mss32.dll` (Miles) imports
    `_AIL_waveOutOpen@16`. The count is already *in the name the binary asked
    for*, and no import library is needed to read it.
  * **cdecl.** Every `MSVCRT.dll` import -- `fopen`, `memmove`, `_ftol`. A cdecl
    callee pops **nothing**; the caller cleans up. The answer is 0, and it is
    not a guess.

    Telling cdecl from stdcall cannot be done by looking for `@N` in the DLL's
    export table, which is the obvious idea and is wrong: `KERNEL32.dll`
    exports `Sleep` undecorated and `dinput.dll` exports `DirectInputCreateA`
    undecorated, and both are stdcall. The `@N` lives in the *import library*,
    not the export table. So the undecorated-export rule is restricted to the
    C-runtime DLL families, which are cdecl by definition; anything else with
    no import library stays None.
  * **C++ mangled names.** `MSVCP60.dll` imports 85 `basic_string` and iostream
    methods. The mangling encodes the calling convention, so the cdecl ones
    (`YA`, `SA`) are certain; `__thiscall`/`__stdcall` members are not, because
    the argument *byte* count needs the parameter types and a struct passed by
    value has no knowable size.

Every one of those strategies reads the count off a **name**, and names run out.
A DLL that exports by ordinal only, with no import library anywhere on the
machine, defeats all of them -- and arcade ports are made of those: Mario Kart
Arcade GP DX imports 40 functions from OMRON's OKAO Vision libraries purely by
ordinal, and those DLLs exist nowhere but in the game tree.

So there is one more strategy, and it does not read a name at all:

  * **`purge_from_binary` reads the callee's own `ret N`.** If you have a copy
    of the DLL -- and if the game shipped it, you do -- the byte count is in
    its code. Pass `ArgcResolver(dll_dirs=[game_tree])` and it is tried last,
    after every name-based strategy, including for the `__thiscall` members
    whose types are unknowable. Checked against the SDK import libraries over
    every export where both have an answer: **1,307 agree, 2 disagree** across
    kernel32, user32, gdi32 and ws2_32.

    On Mario Kart Arcade GP DX v1.00.32 that takes the import table from 449 of
    495 resolved to **489 of 495**. The six left are `d3dx9_43`'s math
    functions, which export a `jmp dword ptr [...]` CPU-dispatch thunk whose
    slot is filled at DLL init -- nothing static can follow that, and it says
    None rather than reading the padding after the jump.

`lookup` returns None rather than guessing. Callers should refuse to emit an
import they could not resolve: a placeholder count is the exact failure this
module exists to prevent. `lookup_ex` returns *why*, so a caller can tell "cdecl,
pops nothing" from "no idea" -- they need opposite handling and both used to
arrive as None.

Part of the pcrecomp toolbox.

# where a real game's import table gets interesting: a third-party DLL with an
# undecorated export table, or one that exports by ordinal only and has no
# import library anywhere on the machine. Arcade ports are all of them at once
# -- Mario Kart Arcade GP DX imports 40 functions from OMRON's OKAO Vision
# libraries by ordinal, and those DLLs exist nowhere but in the game tree.
#
# But the count is not only in the name. It is in the callee: a stdcall
# function ends `ret N`, and N is the byte count. If you have the DLL -- and if
# the game ships it, you do -- you can read the answer out of its code instead
# of guessing at its types.
#
# Measured against the counts the Windows SDK import libraries give, for the
# exports where both have an answer: 1,307 agree, 2 disagree, across kernel32,
# user32, gdi32 and ws2_32. So this is a fallback and not a replacement -- the
# import library still wins wherever it has an answer -- but where nothing else
# can speak it is right about as often as a published header.
#
# Two shapes it deliberately refuses rather than guesses at:
#   * `jmp dword ptr [...]` -- a CPU-dispatch thunk. d3dx9_43's math functions
#     are all of these: the slot is filled at DLL init with an SSE or an x87
#     implementation, and nothing static can follow it.
