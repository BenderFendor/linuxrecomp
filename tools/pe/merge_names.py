"""Merge every symbol source into one name per address, fit to paste into C.

This repo now recovers names from several places, and they disagree in quality:

    map_names.py      real symbols from a linker MAP          -- authoritative
    rtti.py           Class__ADDR from MSVC RTTI              -- a real class
    debug_symbols.py  which source file a function came from  -- a grouping
    (anything else)   Ghidra, IDA, a hand-written list

Nothing combined them, so a project picked one and threw the rest away. This
takes them in precedence order, first source wins per address, and reports what
each contributed so a source that adds nothing can be dropped.

    python tools/pe/merge_names.py --source map=map.json --source rtti=rtti.json \\
                                   --files src.json -o names.json

Sanitising is the point, not a detail
-------------------------------------
The names worth having are not C identifiers. A MAP gives `_SmackOpen@12` and
`??0CColour@@QAE@HHH@Z`; RTTI gives `?$vector@H@std`. Generated code cannot use
any of them, so every consumer either sanitises and risks collisions or gives
up and keeps `sub_00430400`.

Collisions are the trap. The signature is kept precisely so overloads stay
apart -- `?f@@QAE@XZ` and `?f@@QAE@HH@Z` become `f_QAE_XZ` and `f_QAE_HH_Z`,
which is ugly and correct. But `@` and `_` both map to `_`, so any two symbols
differing only in which separator they used collide: `a@b` and `a_b` are one
identifier afterwards, and so are a mangled name and a hand-written one for the
same function. Letting one silently win produces C that does not compile, or
worse, compiles and calls the other function. Here the first claim keeps the
identifier and every later one gets its address appended, so the output is
always unique.
