"""Recover function names from an MSVC linker MAP, and carry library names
from a binary that has one onto a binary that does not.

Two modes.

  resolve   MAP + PE -> {va: name} for the binary the MAP belongs to.

  port      Carry *library* names from a donor that has a MAP onto a target
            that does not, by matching library code byte for byte. The CRT,
            MFC and any statically linked middleware are the same machine code
            in every binary built against the same toolchain, so one MAP names
            that code everywhere.

A linker MAP is the best symbol source a binary can have and is not rare --
games shipped them by accident all the time, next to the executable on the
disc. Where one exists, use it before any heuristic.

    python tools/pe/map_names.py resolve game.map game.exe -o names.json
    python tools/pe/map_names.py port --donor a.exe --donor-map a.map \\
                                      --target b.exe -o names.json

Why Rva+Base and not section:offset
-----------------------------------
The Xbox version of this has to do section arithmetic, because imagebld throws
the preferred load address away when it emits an XBE. A plain PE keeps it, and
MSVC writes the resolved address into the MAP's own `Rva+Base` column, so here
the address can simply be read. The port got *simpler*.

Verify the MAP describes the binary
-----------------------------------
A MAP and an EXE sitting in the same folder are not necessarily the same build,
and a mismatched pair yields a large number of confidently wrong names -- far
worse than no names at all, because every one of them is a lie you will act on.
The MAP states its own entry point; comparing that to the PE header's is a free
identity check, and `resolve` refuses to write unless they agree or you pass
--force.
